  # Get Ramaze #

  ## gem
  The simplest way of installing Ramaze is to use the Rubygems package manager:

      $ gem install ramaze

  Now time to [read getting started guide](/getting-started). enjoy!

  ## git
  To get the latest Ramaze code from the darcs repository instead, read Contributing. Alternatively, install the latest Ramaze nightly gem:

      $ wget http://manveru.net/gems/ramaze-nightly/ramaze-nightly.gem
      $ gem install ramaze-nightly.gem

  Make sure your local repo directory is in your $RUBYLIB path.

  For example,

  .bashrc

      export RUBYLIB="path/to/your/ramaze/lib/:$RUBYLIB"

  .zshrc

      export RUBYLIB="path/to/your/ramaze/lib/:$RUBYLIB"
      
  ## Windows Users
  Note: For Windows users, you may wish to install the win32console gem. This will both satisfy the warning generated by ramaze as well as give you pretty colors when you run your server.

      $ gem install win32console
